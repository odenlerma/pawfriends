    "Implement the following plan:\n\n# Plan: Revise README Key Development Prompts\n\n## Objective\nUpdate the \"Key Development Prompts\" section in README.md to reflect the actual prompts used during development, with summaries and reference to the logs file.\n\n## Current State\n- README.md has generic sample prompts (lines 138-175)\n- `logs/user_prompt_submit.json` contains 24 actual logged prompts\n\n## Implementation\n\n### File to Modify\n`/Users/lmph/Desktop/audruey/pawfriends/README.md`\n\n### Changes\nReplace lines 138-177 (Key Development Prompts section) with:\n\n```markdown\n### Key Development Prompts\n\n> 📋 Full prompt history: [`logs/user_prompt_submit.json`](logs/user_prompt_submit.json)\n\n#### 1. Project Standards Setup\n> \"Update `CLAUDE.md` to include enforced code structure and naming conventions for this React + Vite application...\"\n\nEstablished folder structure, file naming conventions, component patterns, and Zustand store patterns that guided all subsequent development.\n\n#### 2. Dependency Installation & Tooling\n> \"Using `claude.md` as a guide, install all necessary third-party packages. Additionally, set up aliases...\"\n\nInstalled Zustand, React Router, Vitest, Zod, and configured the `@` import alias for clean imports.\n\n#### 3. Core Application Build\n> \"Build a web app called PawFriends where users can: Sign up and log in, Add their pets, Match their pets with others... Use the provided logo for branding.\"\n\nPrimary development prompt that established the full application including:\n- User authentication flow\n- Pet profile management (CRUD)\n- Tinder-style swipe matching interface\n- Brand colors extracted from logo\n\n#### 4. Supabase to REST API Migration\n> \"Replace the current Supabase integration in this repository with a Node.js-based REST API...\"\n\nMajor architectural change from BaaS to custom backend:\n- Express 5 API server\n- Knex.js for database queries\n- Cloudinary for image storage\n- JWT authentication\n\n#### 5. UX State Enhancement\n> \"Using frontend-design skill, modify loading states, error states and success states in login, signup and matching\"\n\nCreated distinctive pet-themed feedback animations:\n- Walking paw prints for loading states\n- Friendly \"droopy pup\" error messages\n- Celebratory success animations\n\n#### 6. Error Handling System\n> \"Look into issue where upon api failure or error, it does not display any error message\"\n\nImplemented toast notification system to surface API errors that were previously silent.\n\n#### 7. Backend Security Hardening\n> \"Using senior-backend skill, evaluate and modify pawfriends-api to use Sequelize and Helmet\"\n\nUpgraded backend with:\n- Sequelize ORM (replacing Knex)\n- Helmet security headers\n- Improved validation patterns\n\n#### 8. CI/CD Pipeline\n> \"Set up a deployment workflow for this repository using GitHub Actions\"\n\nCreated GitHub Actions workflows for:\n- CI validation on PRs (lint, test, build)\n- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on merge to main\n```\n\n## Verification\n1. Run dev server to confirm README renders correctly\n2. Verify log file link works: `logs/user_prompt_submit.json`\n3. Confirm prompts accurately represent logged content\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/lmph/.claude/projects/-Users-lmph-Desktop-audruey-pawfriends/3e952e28-a6f8-458c-8713-fae2949dc2ce.jsonl",
