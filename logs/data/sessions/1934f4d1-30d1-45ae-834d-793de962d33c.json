    "# Objective\n\nUpdate `CLAUDE.md` to include enforced code structure and naming conventions for this React + Vite application.\n\n## Instructions\n- Clearly define the required folder and file structure for the web app repository based on best practices for React + Vite projects.\n- Specify enforced naming conventions for files, components, and variable names to ensure project consistency.\n- Add clear sections for both the web app repository and the REST API repository, noting that this document focuses on the web app but may reference standards to be applied across both.\n- After drafting each section, validate that all code structure and naming conventions are explicitly and unambiguously documented; revise for completeness if any aspect is missing or unclear.\n\n## Context\n- This document (`CLAUDE.md`) acts as a central guideline for repository organization and code standards.\n- There are two repositories:\n  - One for the **web application** (React + Vite) this repository\n  - One for the **REST API** '/Users/lmph/Desktop/audruey/pawfriends-api'\n\n## Output Format\n- Use Markdown formatting with headings, sub-headings, and code blocks where appropriate to illustrate directory trees or code examples.\n\n## Stop Condition\n- The document is considered complete when all code structure and naming conventions for the React + Vite application are explicitly documented, and references to the REST API repository are included as needed for cross-repository consistency."
